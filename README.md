# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to enhance my skills and knowledge, I developed a simple space invaders game using Python and the Arcade library. The game involves controlling a player spaceship to shoot down incoming enemy spaceships while avoiding their projectiles. The objective is to survive for as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

# Description

In the game, players control a spaceship using the left and right arrow keys to move horizontally, and the spacebar to shoot bullets upwards. The player must aim to destroy the enemy spaceships while dodging their attacks. As the game progresses, the enemies move faster and become more numerous, posing a greater challenge to the player. The game ends when the player's spaceship collides with an enemy spaceship or gets hit by an enemy projectile.

# Purpose

The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience in game development using Python and Arcade. By creating a simple game like space invaders, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of game mechanics, object-oriented programming, and user input handling. Additionally, developing this game provided an opportunity to practice problem-solving skills and learn how to utilize external libraries effectively.

# Development Environment

I developed the game using the following tools:
- **Python**: Programming language used for game development.
- **Arcade Library**: Python library for creating 2D games.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites helpful:
* [Arcade Documentation](https://arcade.academy/documentation.html): Official documentation for the Arcade library, providing guidance on how to use its features and functions.
* [Python.org](https://www.python.org/): Official website for the Python programming language, offering resources, tutorials, and documentation for Python developers.

# Future Work

In future iterations of the game, I plan to:
* Implement sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
* Add more enemy types and power-ups to increase variety and replay value.
* Implement a scoring system and leaderboard to track players' performance.
* Improve graphics and visual effects to make the game more visually appealing.
* Optimize game performance and handle edge cases more effectively.
